/* Multiple-Inheritance is the resources of the Object Oriented Programming Languages 
in which child class or subclass can inherit the resources of the multiple parent classes or 
superclasses.

PHP doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance but by using Interfaces in PHP or using Traits in PHP instead of classes, we can implement it.

Syntax:

            class child_class_name extends parent_class_name {
                   use trait_name;
                     ...
                     ...
                   child_class functions
*/
  

class A { 
  public function show() { 
     echo "It's "; 
  } 
} 
  

trait B { 
  public function display() { 
     echo " Oop Task "; 
  } 
} 
  
class C extends A { 
   use B; 
   public function view() { 
      echo "\n For Assessment"; 
  }  
} 
  
$c = new C(); 
$c->show(); 
$c->display(); 
$c->view();
